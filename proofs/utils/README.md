# Utilities

This folder contains constructions and algebraic structures that are used by Dilithium, but not specific to Dilithium.
This is to be treated and used as a collection of libraries.

For example, this should contain polynomials mod an ideal (`PolyReduce.ec`).
Moreover, this can contain "external" projects such as SHA-3.

This is just a Swiss army knife where all kind of random things live.
